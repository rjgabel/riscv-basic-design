# riscv-basic-design

As a project, I wanted to learn more about microarchitecture and hardware description languages. I was particularly interested in the RISC-V ISA because it's an open and modern ISA. I learned how to use and create code in Transact-Verilog as well as the basics of how CPUs work.

The is an implementation of the RISC-V ISA in Transact-Verilog. You can run this using the Makerchip IDE (https://makerchip.com/). If you're interested, I suggest this course (https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFD111x+1T2024/home).
